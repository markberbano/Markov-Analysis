# Markov-Analysis
This code takes a piece of text and analyzes how, given a a sequence of starting successive words in the text (in this case, 2 words), the probability of other words following. The code takes in a piece of text and returns a dictionary showing all the words of the text and what words follow. This can be used to randomly generate a full piece of text using just starting words.

This practice example was taken from GreenTeaExpress' Think Python: http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf
